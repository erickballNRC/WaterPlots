# WaterPlots
Visualize the phase changes and supercritical behavior of water at high temperature and pressure

This script plots a visualization of the specific volume of water as a function of pressure and temperature,
illustrating the effect of temperature on phase change, the meaning of the critical point, and the behavior
of the supercritical fluid. Notably on these plots it becomes clear that the critical point is not 
a sharp boundary, it just continues the trend of the phase change having less effect as pressure/temp increases.

The data is a bit choppy so the boundaries are not smooth, but the overall trends are shown well enough.

The first figure shown uses color to indicate density.

The second figure uses interactive 3D plotting to show the specific volume, so the height of the vertical 
portion at a given point on the saturation line corresponds to the increase in volume due to a phase change.
Note that specific volume is on a log scale to improve visual clarity.
